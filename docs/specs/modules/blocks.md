# Blocks Module PRD (`ideanet-blocks`)

## Overview
The blocks module provides a plugin-based content system that allows users to create structured, interactive content within their projects. Built on BlockNote.js, it supports extensible block types through a plugin architecture, enabling rich multimedia content and specialized workflows.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **BlockRegistry**: Plugin registration and lifecycle management
- **BlockRenderer**: Dynamic component rendering and state management
- **BlockSchema**: Type definitions and validation for block content
- **PluginLoader**: Security sandbox for third-party plugins

### Dependencies
```toml
# Frontend (package.json)
"@blocknotejs/core": "^0.15.0"
"@blocknotejs/react": "^0.15.0"
"@chakra-ui/react": "^2.8.0"
"react": "^18.2.0"
"zustand": "^4.4.0"          # State management
"react-hotkeys-hook": "^4.4.0" # Keyboard shortcuts
"framer-motion": "^10.16.0"   # Animations

## Plugin Architecture

### Block Plugin Interface
```typescript
interface BlockPlugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  description: string;
  author: string;
  
  // Core block definition
  component: React.ComponentType<BlockProps>;
  schema: BlockSchema;
  
  // Plugin configuration
  config?: BlockConfig;
  dependencies?: string[];
  permissions?: Permission[];
  
  // Lifecycle hooks
  onInstall?: () => Promise<void>;
  onUninstall?: () => Promise<void>;
  onUpdate?: (fromVersion: string) => Promise<void>;
}

interface BlockProps {
  block: BlockInstance;
  editor: BlockNoteEditor;
  updateBlock: (updates: Partial<BlockData>) => void;
  deleteBlock: () => void;
  contentRef: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>;
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Block Registry System
```typescript
class BlockRegistry {
  private plugins: Map<string, BlockPlugin> = new Map();
  private schemas: Map<string, BlockSchema> = new Map();
  
  async registerPlugin(plugin: BlockPlugin): Promise<void> {
    // Validate plugin structure and dependencies
    // Check security permissions and sandbox requirements
    // Register block schema with BlockNote.js
    // Store plugin configuration and metadata
  }
  
  getAvailableBlocks(): BlockType[] {
    // Return list of available block types for slash menu
    // Filter by user permissions and plugin status
    // Include built-in and custom blocks
  }
  
  createBlock(type: string, initialData?: any): BlockInstance {
    // Instantiate block with proper schema validation
    // Apply default configuration and styling
    // Set up event handlers and lifecycle hooks
  }
}
```

### Plugin Security Sandbox
```typescript
interface PluginSandbox {
  // Allowed APIs and capabilities
  allowedAPIs: string[];
  
  // Resource access permissions
  fileSystemAccess: 'none' | 'read' | 'write';
  networkAccess: 'none' | 'limited' | 'full';
  
  // Runtime constraints
  memoryLimit: number;
  executionTimeout: number;
  
  // Data access permissions
  projectDataAccess: 'none' | 'current' | 'all';
  userDataAccess: boolean;
}

class PluginLoader {
  async loadPlugin(pluginPath: string, sandbox: PluginSandbox): Promise<BlockPlugin> {
    // Load plugin in isolated context
    // Apply security constraints and API limitations
    // Validate plugin against sandbox permissions
    // Return safely wrapped plugin instance
  }
}
```

### Block Component Development
```typescript
// Example custom block implementation
export const IdeaBlock: React.FC<BlockProps> = ({ block, updateBlock, editor }) => {
  const [idea, setIdea] = useState<IdeaData>(block.props);
  
  const handleTitleChange = (title: string) => {
    setIdea(prev => ({ ...prev, title }));
    updateBlock({ title });
  };
  
  const handlePriorityChange = (priority: Priority) => {
    setIdea(prev => ({ ...prev, priority }));
    updateBlock({ priority });
  };
  
  return (
    <Card variant="outline" borderLeft={`4px solid ${getPriorityColor(idea.priority)}`}>
      <CardHeader>
        <HStack justify="space-between">
          <Input
            value={idea.title}
            onChange={(e) => handleTitleChange(e.target.value)}
            placeholder="Idea title..."
            variant="unstyled"
            fontWeight="bold"
          />
          <Select value={idea.priority} onChange={(e) => handlePriorityChange(e.target.value)}>
            <option value="low">Low</option>
            <option value="medium">Medium</option>
            <option value="high">High</option>
            <option value="critical">Critical</option>
          </Select>
        </HStack>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardBody>
        <InlineContent
          value={idea.description}
          onChange={(desc) => updateBlock({ description: desc })}
          placeholder="Describe your idea..."
        />
      </CardBody>
    </Card>
  );
};
```
